Spull turns one or more links into a selectable download queue. It keeps the interface quiet and predictable: inspect first, choose what to keep, then download to a folder you control.

## What it does

| Area | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Inspect** | Analyzes single videos and playlists with yt-dlp JSON output. Each link has a 90-second process deadline. |
| **Select** | Shows playlist entries with thumbnails, durations, source labels, and per-item selection. |
| **Download** | Runs a sequential queue with live yt-dlp output, elapsed time, ETA, retry support, stall detection, cancel control, and selectable audio/video quality. |
| **Formats** | MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, MP4, and WEBM. Audio exports receive square, center-cropped album art; MP3/M4A bitrate and MP4/WEBM resolution can be selected. |
| **Compatibility** | Loads yt-dlp's extractor catalog with search and `CURRENTLY BROKEN` markers. Catalog lookup has a 30-second deadline and cancel control. |
| **Authentication** | Uses a browser cookie profile or a selected `cookies.txt` file when a source requires login. |
| **Bootstrap** | Reuses local tools when possible. Downloads report speed and remaining time; servers without `Content-Length` use an indeterminate progress bar instead of a fake percentage. |

> Use Spull only for media you are allowed to download. yt-dlp support depends on the source site and its current policies.

## Screenshots in one sentence

Light logo-derived colors, compact pixel accents, no decorative clutter: the queue and its current state remain the visual priority.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Flutter stable with Dart 3.13 or newer.
- Internet access on first launch if yt-dlp, FFmpeg, or optional Deno must be installed.
- Existing `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` binaries on `PATH` are detected and reused.
- **Windows:** Visual Studio Build Tools with the Desktop C++ workload.
- **macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools.
- **Linux:** `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja-build`, `pkg-config`, `libgtk-3-dev`, and `libstdc++-12-dev`.

### Run locally

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
# or
flutter run -d macos
# or
flutter run -d linux
```

### Build locally

```bash
flutter build windows --release
flutter build macos --release
flutter build linux --release
```

The complete Flutter runtime bundle is required at launch. Do not copy only `spull.exe` or only the Linux executable.

## Dependency resolution

Spull checks executable locations in this order:

1. `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Spull/bin` on Windows, or the platform Spull data directory on macOS/Linux.
2. `bin/` beside the installed `spull` executable.
3. The system `PATH`.

The first-launch bootstrap can install:

- **yt-dlp** — required for analysis and downloads.
- **FFmpeg** — required for audio extraction and media conversion.
- **Deno** — optional; improves extractor compatibility.

Bootstrap status includes the current tool, progress mode, transfer speed, and ETA when a total size is available. A partial download is kept separate until it completes, so an interrupted tool download does not replace a working binary.

### Long downloads and stall recovery

Actual media downloads use a no-output watchdog in addition to yt-dlp's network
timeouts:

- Five minutes without any yt-dlp or FFmpeg output is shown as `응답 없음`.
- The current process tree is terminated so a hidden child process cannot keep
  running.
- Spull retries the same item once with yt-dlp's `--continue` support.
- If the retry also stalls, the item fails visibly and the queue stops instead
  of waiting forever.
- A manual `CANCEL` remains an explicit stop and does not trigger an automatic
  retry.

### Quality controls

- MP3/M4A provide 128K, 192K, 256K, and 320K audio bitrate choices.
- MP4/WEBM provide Best, 2160p, 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, and 360p choices.
- A resolution choice means the best available stream at or below that height;
  yt-dlp falls back to a compatible lower-quality stream when needed.
- WAV/FLAC remain lossless, so bitrate selection is not applied.

## Release artifacts

### Windows

The release workflow produces two archives:

- `spull-windows-x86_64.zip` — portable Flutter bundle. Extract the whole archive and run `spull.exe`.
- `spull-windows-x86_64-setup.zip` — antivirus-safe GUI setup bundle. Extract it and double-click `Install-Spull.vbs`.

The setup bundle contains Windows FFmpeg under `bin/`, so a fresh setup does not wait for the large FFmpeg archive on first launch. The installer defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Spull`, creates Start Menu shortcuts for Spull and `Uninstall Spull`, and can launch the app after installation.

For removal:

- Use the **Uninstall Spull** Start Menu shortcut from an installed copy.
- The setup folder also contains `Uninstall-Spull.vbs` for the default install path.
- For a custom install directory, run the uninstaller copy inside that installed directory.

### Linux

The Linux artifact is a `.tar.gz` containing the complete Flutter bundle at its root. Extract it and run `spull`.

### macOS

The release workflow builds one universal unsigned app bundle:

- `spull-macos-universal.app.zip` — Apple Silicon (`arm64`) and Intel
  (`x86_64`).

The bundle intentionally sets `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED = NO`; it does not
require an Apple Developer account, provisioning profile, or notarization.
Extract the complete archive without separating the launcher from the app,
then double-click `Run-Spull.command`. The launcher searches the extracted
release folder for `spull.app`, removes its download quarantine attribute,
and opens it. If Terminal blocks the launcher, run this trusted-release
fallback from the extracted folder:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine spull.app
open spull.app
```

Unsigned local distribution is not suitable for the Mac App Store. Only
remove quarantine from a release you trust.

## Publishing a release

Feature work must be committed first. The guarded publisher updates the patch release build number, verifies the repository, creates the release commit and annotated tag, then pushes only the requested branch and tag.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File tool/publish_release.ps1 -Version 1.2.4
```

The release tag must point to a commit whose subject starts with `release(scope):`, for example:

```text
release(v1.2.4): publish desktop artifacts
```

The script intentionally performs a targeted push equivalent to:

```bash
git push origin main release-v1.2.4
```

Do **not** use `git push origin main --tags`; that retries every local tag, including tags already present on the remote. GitHub Actions builds Linux, macOS, and Windows only for `release-*` tags. `workflow_dispatch` remains available for manual verification without publishing a release.

## Development checks

Run the same gate used by CI:

```bash
dart run tool/verify.dart
```

This runs dependency resolution, formatting checks, Flutter analysis, and the widget test suite.
